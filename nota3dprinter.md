# ChipShover is not a 3D Printer Controller

ChipShover is missing some key features compared to a 3D printer motherboard:

* Only 3 axis stepper controllers possible (no Extruder axis).
* No heater channels.

The cost of the ChipShover-One *far exceeds* a comparable 3D printer motherboard, as the "device positioning" market is much smaller and thus we cannot hope to achieve the volume of 3D printer drivers.
