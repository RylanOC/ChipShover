**For 6-32 insert:**
  Hole diameter = 4.90 mm

**For 6-32 screw (self-tapping mode):**
  Hole diameter = 3.20 mm

Note that 3D printing results in a smaller hole size, so the above sizes already account for that. The end hole sizes should be:

For 6-32 insert: 4.8mm

For tapping a 6-32 hole: 2.7mm

The 6-32 hole is slightly larger in this plastic as we basically self-tap it, but if you were making this out of aluminum & using a tap the above is the correct size.
