# ChipSHOUTER to 3020 Stage Adapter

These adapters are mounted in place of the spindle holder. It should fit the default M4 bolts used on the frame. Remove the spindle holder, and bolt on the ChipSHOUTER adapter.

If you wish to use a screw insert you can print the HardwareNeeded version, otherwise print the NoHardwareNeeded version.

## Model Notes

The two versions of the model are the same, with the inner diameter of the hole changed:

**For 6-32 insert:**
  Hole diameter = 4.90 mm

**For 6-32 screw (self-tapping mode):**
  Hole diameter = 3.20 mm

Note that 3D printing results in a smaller hole size, so the above sizes already account for that. The end hole sizes should be:

For 6-32 insert: 4.8mm

For tapping a 6-32 hole: 2.7mm

The 6-32 hole is slightly larger in this plastic as we basically self-tap it, but if you were making this out of aluminum & using a tap the above is the correct size.
