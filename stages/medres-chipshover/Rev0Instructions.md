### 1. Place Stage Frame on Table

Check the stage frame for any obvious damage. Remove packing material (foam & cardboard).

### 2. Mount Y Axis Stage on X Axis

Mount the Y Axis stage perpendicular to the X axis stage. You will see alignment labels on the
X-axis stage that should align with the Y-axis stage. Note it will "overhang" the X axis stage to provide sufficient Y axis travel. The steps to perform the mounting are:

1. Using the handwheel, turn the Y axis stage until all **8** bolt-holes are visible underneath the Y axis stage (4 on each side). You will need to extend it almost to it's full limit for this.
2. Remove the 3x M6 bolts from the package.
3. Place the Y axis stage on the X axis stage - use alignment marks to position it, and keep one hand on the stage to avoid dropping it. Note that only **3** of the holes have matching threads.

4. Insert the M6 bolts, and using a 5mm hex driver tighten each bolt.

5. Using the Y axis handwheel, return the stage back to the "home" position (you'll hear the microswitch click). 

### 3. Mount Z Plate on Y Axis

1. Remove the 4x M6 bolts from the bag labelled "Z Plate to Y Axis Mounting Bolts".
2. Remove the Z plate from the packaging, and place on the Y axis stage.
3. Align the "Mount Z Plate" arrows, and insert the four bolts.

4. Tighten the bolts - you'll have an ability to later fine-tune this mounting. You will want to make sure there is some clearance at the front of the Z axis mount when the Y axis is at the home position.

### 4. Mount Z Axis on Z Plate

You will be mounting the Z axis "lower" on the Z plate to provide a reasonable working distance for the ChipSHOUTER. The following photo shows where we will be mating the provided 2x M6 bolts - note we are *not* using the upper slot.

1. Remove the 2x M6 bolts labelled "Z Axis to Z Plate Mounting Bolts"
2. Align the edge of the Z axis with the alignment marks on the Z plate.
3. Insert the 2x bolts that will mate into the threaded holes on the Z plate:

4. Optionally use the M6x20 bolts with the M6 locknuts.

HINT: You can adjust the position of the Z axis mounting for your own use, we simply provide a suggested mount location.

### 5. Add Cable Mounts

You will use the Cable Mounts for routing stepper motor & ChipSHOUTER cables. The suggested uses is as shown here:

To insert them, simply insert into the slot and rotate the cable mounts:

To achieve the suggested mount locations, see this figure:

### 6. Connect Stepper Cables

The stepper motor cables are all standard DB-9 straight-through cables. The provided cables are 22AWG cables allowing a more powerful drive, although we have tested with standard 26AWG IDC cables successfully. Thus if you require extensions or replacements, and off the shelf cable should work.

Due to the spacing at the ChipShover controller

The X/Y/Z/ axis cables have been labelled to make setup quicker. To connect them:

1. Connect each cable to the DB9 connector on each stage. The Z axis connector is straight up and the cable should be routed to a cable mount.
2. Connect the other end of each cable to the ChipShover controller.
3. Use the provided 1/4" long 4-40 bolts to screw the cables into the ChipShover.

### 7. Add ChipSHOUTER Mounting Bracket

### 8. Mount ChipSHOUTER

## Adjusting Coarse Position

### Y Adjustment

### Z Adjustment

#### Lowering

#### Raising

## Mounting Boards to Base Plate
