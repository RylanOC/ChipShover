# Medium Res Stage - Rev 0

## Stage Assembly & Setup

### 1. Place Stage Frame on Table

Check the stage frame for any obvious damage. Remove packing material (foam & cardboard).

### 2. Mount Y Axis Stage on X Axis

Mount the Y Axis stage perpendicular to the X axis stage. You will see alignment labels on the
X-axis stage that should align with the Y-axis stage. Note it will "overhang" the X axis stage to provide sufficient Y axis travel. The steps to perform the mounting are:

1. Using the handwheel, turn the Y axis stage until all **8** bolt-holes are visible underneat the Y axis stage (4 on each side). You will need to extend it almost to it's full limit for this.
2. Remove the 3x M6 bolts from the package.
3. Place the Y axis stage on the X axis stage - use alignment marks to position it, and keep one hand on the stage to avoid dropping it. Note that only **3** of the holes have matching threads.

4. Insert the M6 bolts, and using a 5mm hex driver tighten each bolt.
